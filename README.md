Reflix Project 🎬

Reflix is a movie rental app. It allows a user to browse a catalog of movies, and select some to rent, so long as the user has the budget for it. This is a very special kind of renting system wherein the money is returned to the user when the movie is returned.



The app has three main views: the Landing Page, the Catalog Page, and the Movie Detail Page. 

You can click the following pictures to embiggen them.
